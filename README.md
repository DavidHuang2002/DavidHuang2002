# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am David

I am studying for a B.S. in Computer Science in Vanderbilt University. I expect to graduate in Spring, 2026.

## Projects I am working on

### <a href="https://github.com/DavidHuang2002/ifam-attendance-portal">  I-FAM Events and Attendance Portal </a>

A web platform has both a public front that will allow the organization International Family to post their events and allow participants to RSVP, as well as an admin portal to allow event organizers to take attendance and see analytics about past attendances. Building using Next.js + Firebase.

## Projects I have built

### Device Management platform

A simple device management microservice platform that connects to IoT devices (such as Raspberry Pi and coffee machines), displays their current states and sends alert emails based on rules that users set.

The backend is a microservice built with .NET framework, containerized with Docker, and deployed onto Azure Web Service. The service leverages Azure Cloudâ€™s IoT hub, Stream Analytics, and Service Bus for connecting to devices, processing their messages, and receiving them in the service.

A simple Vue.js front-end for the platform.
